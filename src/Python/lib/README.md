# Lib folder

This directory contains source code for processes which are partially independent of the anaysis pipeline.
They are tasks that may be reused in other scenarios and contexts.

For example:

- Implement calculations of network/graph metrics
- Make queries to a database
- Download files
- Make http requests
- Read/write files
- Construct and change data structures
