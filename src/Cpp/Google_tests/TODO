- Read the Interactome for the 3 levels
    X Get nodes as vector.
    X Adds a node
    X Get neighbors of a node.
    X Get interactors of a nonexistent node throws exception
    X Ask interactome if node exists by index
    X Read node names
    X Read nodes called again removes previous names
    X Check that node names are not repeated.
    X Check that nodes in the names input stream are not repeated.
    X Set initial names of nodes to empty string.
    X Throw exception when requesting name of a non existet node.
    X Throw exception when the stream has a different number of labels than the number of nodes.
    X Ask interactome if node exists by name
    - Refactor that all nodes in ranges exist.
    - Change constructor with edges to function to read interactions.
    - Remove constructor with only edges. --> Replace with ranges
    - Get type of a node.
    - Read types of nodes.
    - Get neighbors if a specific type:

    - Create network from an edge file:
        - Be able to create network with an interaction list. The interactions are pairs of integers.
        - Read a list of interactions from a file.
    - Read the labels of the nodes in the network
    - Get the name of an index entity
    - Read the mapping from genes to proteins
    - Get the proteins corresponding to a gene
    - Read the mapping from protein to proteoforms
    - Get the proteoforms corresponding to a protein
    - Get the type of a node

Interactome class:
X Create a network from a list of edges


Interactome Reader class:
- Read a file with a list of edges and call to create a network.

Module class:
- Be able to add vertices
- Be able to add edges
- Be able to create a module from a list of vertices (for the gene modules)
- Be able to create a module from a list of edges (for the protein and proteoform modules)
- Get entity neighbors of a gene

ModuleReader class:
- Read the phegeni style file and get a sets of vertices to create modules.
