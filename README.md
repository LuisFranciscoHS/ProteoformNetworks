# Proteoform networks in biological network analysis

This project compares the protein networks with proteoform networks for functional analysis studies. For detailed documentation see our [wiki](https://github.com/PathwayAnalysisPlatform/ProteoformNetworks/wiki).

We want to prove that proteoform networks provide multiple advantages for functional analysis over protein or gene networks.

Therefore we provide examples for the following assertions:

1. [More specific reaction and pathway mapping](https://github.com/PathwayAnalysisPlatform/ProteoformNetworks/wiki/1-node-degree-reduction)
1. [Disease modules in Proteoform networks have robustness and network properties](https://github.com/PathwayAnalysisPlatform/ProteoformNetworks/wiki/2-Percolation-Analysis)
1. [Proteoform networks can rule out gene-centric module overlap](https://github.com/PathwayAnalysisPlatform/ProteoformNetworks/wiki/3-Rule-Out-Gene-Centric-Overlap)
1. [Proteoform networks can show key post translational modifications linking multiple diseases or biological processes](https://github.com/PathwayAnalysisPlatform/ProteoformNetworks/wiki/4-key-PTMs-overlap)
