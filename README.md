This project compares the interaction networks for the functional analysis studies. The commonly used networks are gene and protein
interaction networks.

We want to prove that proteoform networks provide multiple advantages for functional analysis over protein or gene networks.
Therefore we provide examples for the following assertions:

1. [More specific reaction and pathway mapping](#proteoform-networks-enable-more-specific-reaction-and-pathway-mapping)
1. [Proteoform networks can show key post translational modifications linking multiple diseases or biological processes](#proteoform-networks-can-show-key-post-translational-modifications-linking-multiple-diseases-or-biological-processes)
1. [Proteoform networks can dismantle artefactual module overlap](#proteoform-networks-can-disassemble-artefactual-module-overlap)
1. [Proteoform networks contain fewer hub nodes with smaller degree](#proteoform-networks-contain-fewer-hub-nodes-with-smaller-degree)

## Proteoform networks enable more specific reaction and pathway mapping

Proteoform networks can reduce the number of candidate reactions an pathways for a set of input entities.

## Proteoform networks can show key post translational modifications linking multiple diseases or biological processes
## Proteoform networks can disassemble artefactual module overlap

We call artefactual module overlap those that only show at the gene or protein level but not at proteoform network. This reveals a separation in modification mechanisms, implying a different logic in the process behind the protein activity.

## Proteoform networks contain fewer hub nodes with smaller degree

What are hub nodes?

What is the consequence of having them?

Why do we prefer to have less hub nodes?

Proteoform network analysis requires a different set of tools according to this level of specificity.
