# Proteoforms in biological network analysis

This project compares gene networks with proteoform networks for functional analysis studies. <br>
We want to prove that proteoform networks also provide useful insights for functional analysis that could be obtained only with protein or gene networks. <br>
For detailed documentation see our [wiki](https://github.com/PathwayAnalysisPlatform/ProteoformNetworks/wiki).
